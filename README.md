## Bulk Discounts
This project is an extension of the Little Esty Shop group project. You will add functionality for merchants to create bulk discounts for their items. A “bulk discount” is a discount based on the quantity of items the customer is buying, for example “20% off orders of 10 or more items”.

## Learning Goals
Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
